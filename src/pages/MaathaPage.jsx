    <p>Gurupaadadhooli Smt Ananthalakshmi Natarajan, known in short as
Anantham, and addressed affectionately as 'maataa' (mother), has been
working untiringly for spreading the knowledge of Sanskrit, our shastras
and Indian culture since several decades. Smt.Ananthalaksmi Natarajan
has done her post graduation in mathematics and is a retired teacher of
Stella Maris High School, Vyalikaval, Bangalore. She represents a rare
combination of sanskrit, shastras, vedic knowledge, music, mathematics,
literature and general knowledge.</p>
<p>She hails from a very cultured and intellectual family. Born in the year
1943, to a father, an astute mathematician, and a mother, a great
Sanskrit pandit, who have laid foundation for her present day status. She
learnt carnatic music from Sri.Balaganesha Iyer for 15 years from the age
of seven.</p>
<p>Her mother’s teacher, Sri.Vaidyanatha Sastrigal, was later the teacher of
Sringeri acharya Srimad Abhinava Vidyatheertha Mahaswamigal. This
teacher, under the guidance of Sri Sri Sri Chandrashekara Bharathi
Swamigal of the Sringeri matham, became a sanyasi by the name
Bhashya-swamigal. Being an ardent devotee of the Sringeri acharyas and
encouraged by the revered acharyas and teachers, Smt.Ananthalakshmi
has been giving upanyasams from a tender age of ten!
She gives religious discourses, directs dance dramas, sanskrit dramas
and conducts free sloka and sanskrit classes for one and all. All these
activities are aimed at spreading the messages of Bhagavadgeetha,
educating one and all on the values and purpose of life as enunciated in
the Hindu scriptures, and creating awareness about the richness of the
sanskrit language and Indian culture. Till date, she has directed more
than 300 dance dramas, 150 sanskrit dance dramas and has given
hundreds of upanyasams in various cities through the length and breadth
of the country. She has also given discourses on various topics in
Singapore, Bahrain, Dubai and USA. Her discourses on all the
‘pashurams’ of Tiruppavai was telecast by TTD-SVBC2 Kannada channel
in the year 2017- https://youtu.be/XKHnEH6xlbk</p>
<p>She is very eager to teach children wherever she goes. In most places
wherever she gives upanyasams, she has trained local children and
made them perform dance-dramas and Sanskrit dramas. Her nrityaroopakas on Geethagovindam has attracted a lot of attention and she
has been hailed for the effort. She has also composed and presented
short, educative sanskrit dramas on subjects like Ramayana,
Bhagavatam, Shankara-Digvijaya, and topics related to Sanatana
Dharma.</p>
<p>The main themes for her discourses (Upanyasams) are on -</p>
<ul>
  <li>Geetha-Govindam of Sri Jayadeva Mahakavi,</li>
<li> Krishna-Leela-Tarangini of Sri Narayana Teertha</li>
<li>The Bhagavadgeetha,</li>
<li> Tiruppavai</li>
<li>Srimad Valmiki Ramayanam,</li>
<li>Srimad Bhaagavatham,</li>
<li>Sri Naarayaneeyam,</li>
<li>Srivaishnava Saints and Nayamnar Saints</li>
<li>Mukunda Maala</li>
<li>Bhaktavijaya,</li>
<li>Vivekachoodamani</li>
<li>Stothras and Works of Sri Shankara Bhagavatpadaacharya</li>
</ul>
<p>For the past 40 years, she has been the secretary of Hindu Samaya
Maadar Manram, a satsang for ladies established under the guidance
and blessings of Kanchi Shankaracharya Swamigal. This organization
is spreading the message of bhakti through group prayers, service to
the needy, Geetha jnana yagna, Rukmini Kalyanam, Radha Kalyanam
etc.</p>
<p>Being an ardent devotee of Sri Jagannatha of Puri, she, with the cooperation of the devotees conducts Rathayaatraa of Lord Jagannatha
at Vyalikaval, coinciding with the date of Rathayaatraa at Puri.
Being a voracious reader of various epics with a language repertoire
spanning across Sanskrit, English, Kannada and Tamil, she writes
regularly for periodicals like Sudharma (the Sanskrit daily) and
Shankara Krupa (the Kannada monthly). She has authored several
books like ‘Geetha-Amrutha-Mahima’, ‘Nayamnar Santaru’,
‘Pavanapurapatimahimaa’ and ‘Shivaleelarnava’ in Kannada and
English. Her book in Kannada, giving meanings for all namas of
‘Lalitasahasranamam’ has been approved and blessed by the
Jagadguru of Sringeri. ‘Shaanmatam’ and ‘Prabhavavybhavam’ are
books of prayers compiled by her.</p>
<p>She is a very dedicated teacher, and one who practices before she
preaches. Her impeccable character, strict adherence to the principles
of sanatana dharma, and unshakeable devotion to gurus have inspired
generations of students. She is as ready to teach varnamala to a kid
beginning sanskrit, as she is to describe the profound philosophy of
Viveka Choodamani.</p>
<p>Being the founder and managing trustee of Shri P.N.Ramachandra Iyer
Trust, she has built a community hall named “Nanda Kishore Bhavan”
at Vidyaranyapuram, Bangalore. This bhavan is being utilized by people
from all walks of life to promote Bharathiya Samskriti and to undertake
activities of Sanathana Dharma. The trust helps needy students in their
education upto the post graduate level. The trust also conducts free
marriages for deserving couples and disburses free medicines too.</p>
<br />
<p>Smt. Ananthalakshmi Natarajan established the Geetha Govinda
Samskrita Sangha (GGSS) a non-profit organization in 1976, with the
blessings of the Jagadguru of Sringeri, with an aim to nurture and
preserve samskrita and samskriti. For the past 40 years, GGSS has
been conducting shloka and sanskrit classes for students of all age
groups. There is no monetary fees for classes - however, regularity,
punctuality and humility are the fees that students & parents have to
pay. The organization is supported by volunteers who have been
inspired by the pristine life and lofty ideals of Smt.Ananthalakshmi
Natarajan. Thousands of people have discovered a better way of life
under her guidance at GGSS. The GGSS has several branches in
Bengaluru and 2 branches in Chennai.</p>
<p>GGSS aims to create an awareness of Indian culture and its values in
children, and make them true cultural citizens of 'Bhaarata'. It coaches
students for the sanskrit exams conducted by many reputed
organizations like the Surasaraswathisabha (established by the
Jagadguru of Sringeri), Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, and the Government
of Karnataka. The syllabus for shlokas includes many stotras of Adi
Shankaracharya, the Bhagavadgita, and portions from the epics
(Sankshepa-ramayanam from Srimadramayanam, Gopika gitam from
Srimadbhagavatam,) etc.</p>
<p>GGSS also conducts dharmic activities like charity for theneedy, pujas
